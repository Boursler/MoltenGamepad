0.2.1-beta
2016-09-17
---------------------------

This release has new features and significant code restructuring and bug fixes.

Code and feature set getting more stable, but this is not yet a 1.0 release.

The largest new feature is rumble support, but it carries a caveat and is disabled by default. The uinput kernel module appears to have a bug when a virtual device is destroyed while having force-feedback effects uploaded. When hit, this bug appears to cause a failure state that requires the user to reboot their machine. MoltenGamepad will block destroying these devices until all force-feedback effects are erased, but the user must take care to not forcefully kill the MoltenGamepad process.

Due to the above, rumble support is not enabled by default, but is controlled by a simple `--rumble` command line flag.

Highlights:
* Rumble support added.
* "make eventlists" can auto-generate the correct event lists.
* Relevant "jsX" devices are grabbed in addition to the "eventX" devices.
* `set` command added for global settings.
* `auto_assign` global setting added to assign devices to slots upon connection.
* The `move` command can use `auto` as a slot destination.
* A plug-in API is forming for adding support for more devices.
* `alterslot` deprecated, to be removed in future version.
